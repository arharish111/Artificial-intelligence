Eval function:

The formula for eval value is as below:

Eval value = number of rows,columns and diagonals available to max player - number of rows,columns and diagonals available to min player.

For example a row with values 0,0,0,1,0,0,0 is available to player, playing with coins numbered 1. So, a point of one will be given to this player.
Opposite player will not get any points because by placing his coins in any of the columns will not allow him to make continuous four.

Whereas a row having values 1,0,0,0,0,0,0 will allow both players to make continuous four. Hence a point of one will be given to both players.

Similarly, when a row or column or diagonal is completely filled up with the coins and there is no empty place left, then neither of the players
will get a point.

0000000
0000000
0000000
0000000
2000000
1000000
1

In the above game broad, there are six, seven and twelve rows,columns and diagonals respectively are available for both players to make 
continous four. Hence the eval value will be 0(i.e., 25-25).
